# Environment: Forest
The one element common to all forests is a large number of trees. Beyond that, a forest can be a tropical rainforest, deciduous forest, or pine taiga. You could even have oversized mushrooms, gigantic creeper vines, or even stranger plants.
# Population Level: Hamlet
This region has some small towns or hamlets, with scattered homes or farms in between. The population centers tend to be only a few hundred people at the most.
# Oddity: Monument of Importance
Long ago, something incredibly important happened in a location in this region. This could be a battle, the signing of a treaty, or a scientific or philosophical discovery. Whatever it was, a monument has been erected to memorialize it.
# Tech Level: 6
This age featured the revival of classical learning and brought about significant developments in science, art, architecture, religion, and political ideas in Europe. Gunpowder spread throughout Europe from China, and the feudal system of government began to vanish in Europe, replaced with protomodern governmental organizations.
# Government: None
This is slightly more organized than pure anarchy. Here, government exists on a small scale, with groups of several hundred people electing mayors and councils, being ruled by hereditary lords, or following the banner of small, enterprising warlords. It is up to you what form your social groups take (small townships, roving tribes, or even neighborhoods in a larger city, for example). If you choose or roll this result, roll a d10 die (either for the region as a whole, or for each social group individually). On a 1-4, your social groups are mostly democratic and elect their leaders. On a 5-8, your social groups are controlled by hereditary rulers. On a 9-0, your social groups are organized around charismatic or terrifying warlords and bandit kings.

# Notable Organization: Religious
A group of believers or individuals with the same religious beliefs. The level of organization in this group depends on the level of organization in the religion as a whole, and can range from a strong hierarchy to very disorganized. This could also be a smaller faction within a wider religious group. In that case, they may support reform ideas, have liturgical differences, and support or oppose specific leaders.

The organization expands its power using military means, such as invasions and conquests.

An important figure in this organization/or government is genuinely happy and carefree, and likely doesn't care much about maintaining power or status in their organization.
