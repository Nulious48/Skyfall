Plains are typically some form of grassland, savanna, scrubland, plateau, or other expanse of flattened ground. The plants tend to be grasses or bushes, with few trees to be found.

This region has one major city with a population measured in the tens of thousands or more. It also has several small or mid-sized towns scattered throughout the region. If your technology level is Stone Age, consider rerolling this result.

An extremely valuable resource of your choosing exists in this region. It may make the locals rich, or it may cause outsiders to venture into the region to exploit them.

Beginning in mid-eighteenth-century Britain and spreading to the rest of the world through the early twentieth century, this period marks a switch from an agrarian society to one dominated by industries and machinery. It saw the development of coal-powered steam engines, railroads, machined parts, and factories.

Nation-states are larger than city-states, and they often control several cities and other population centers within their borders. However, each individual nation-state has a shared culture and ethnic heritage, which may vary wildly from nation-state to nation-state. Alternatively, your governments may be organized into nations that host multiple cultures and ethnicities in their borders and are unified under a shared history or an ideal, rather than a shared culture. This nation-states are controlled by hereditary rulers. 

A major organization in this area is motivated politically.

Groups working towards the violent overthrow of an organization or government. A rebellion might wage a guerrilla campaign of terrorism, sabotage, and hit-and-run attacks against a government, in which case it is likely disorganized and fractured. Alternatively, it might be a large group of people with a sizable territory that splits off from a larger state and has infrastructure, organization, and even something of a standing army.

The organization enforces the laws of the land. Corrupt forces or individuals may use their position to exploit those they are supposed to protect.

An important figure in this organization/or government seems calm, quiet, and mild manneredâ€”but they do not hesitate to kill anyone who fails them or stands in their way.
