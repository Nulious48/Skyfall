# Environment
Mountains can be found as vast ranks of serried peaks, a few rocky outcroppings, or even a single massive summit. Cliffs and steep rock covered slopes make up much of this environment, punctuated by swift-flowing streams, high-altitude meadows, and hardy plant and animal life.
# Population Level 
This region has some moderately sized towns with smaller towns or hamlets on their outskirts. The population centers tend to be a few thousand people. If your technology level is Stone Age, consider rerolling this result.
# Oddity
This region is dominated by the ruins from some older species or previous culture. Their technology was likely more advanced than that of the current inhabitants, or at least their constructions remain marvels of engineering that dominate the terrain.
# Tech Level 
Beginning in mid-eighteenth-century Britain and spreading to the rest of the world through the early twentieth century, this period marks a switch from an agrarian society to one dominated by industries and machinery. It saw the development of coal-powered steam engines, railroads, machined parts, and factories.
# Government
Here, each city is also its own state. Cities control the territory around them, trade with their neighbors, make war on their enemies, and generally perform all the tasks of a national government on a more limited scale. Forms of the various city-states' governments may be wildly different, or they may follow a similar pattern across the region or world. This city-state is controlled by guilds or other organized interest groups.
